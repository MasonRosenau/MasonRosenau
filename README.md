### Hey👋
I'm currently finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science at Oregon State University! You can find out more about me and my experience at [my website](https://masonrosenau.com/).

Here are the tools I most commonly use:
| Category | Experience |
|-|-|
| Languages               | ![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,c,cpp,kotlin,html,bash) |
| Frameworks & Web        | ![Frameworks & Web](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=django,flask,mysql,redis) |
| DevOps & Infrastructure | ![DevOps & Infrastructure](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cloudflare,docker,gcp,githubactions,raspberrypi) |



Here's what I'm up to and how it's making me feel:
```c
struct Course { char* name; int difficulty; };

struct Course spring_term[] = {
    {"Computer Architecture", 9},
    {"Parallel Programming",  6},
    {"Translators",           7},
    {"Capstone - HempDB",     5}
};

char* current_mood(struct Course c) {
    return (c.difficulty >= 9) ? "💀" : (c.difficulty >= 7) ? "😅" : "🙂";
}
```
